Scientific Question: Is the structural similarity between the Hemagglutinin (HA) of H1N1 and that of H5N1 potentially explaining the reason why the avian influenza virus H5N1 can also infect human beings?

Scientific Hypothesis: If there is a structural similarity between the HA of H1N1 and that of H5N1, then H5N1 can potentially infect human beings as the same way that H1N1 infects human beings.

I uploaded six files. The files "BIMM 143 - Project 2C - Juanyu Zhang.Rmd" and "BIMM 143 - Project 2C - Juanyu Zhang.nb.html" are drafts of my project 2. The files "AAsequence-H1N1.fasta" and "AAsequence-H5N1.fasta" are amino acid sequences for H1N1 HA and H5N1 HA. The files "Gene-H1N1" and "Gene-H5N1" are DNA sequences for H1N1 HA and H5N1 HA.
